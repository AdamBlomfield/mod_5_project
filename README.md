## Next steps
---------------
### Use with github
As part of the project creation process a local git repository is initialized and committed. If you want to store the repo on github perform the following steps:

1. Create a an empty repository (no License or README) on github with the name mod_5_project.git.
2. Push the local repo to github. From within the root directory of your local project execute the following:

```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/(Your Github UserName Here)/mod_5_project.git
  git push -u origin master
```

3. Create a branch with (replace ```branch_name``` with whatever you want to call your branch):
```
  git branch branch_name
```
4. Checkout the branch:
```
  git checkout branch_name
```

If you are working with a group do not share jupyter notebooks. The other members of the group should pull from the master repository, create and checkout their own branch, then create separate notebooks within the notebook directories (e.g., copy and rename the original files). Be sure to follow the naming convention. All subsequent work done on the project should be done in the respective branches.


### Environment Variables
-------------------
The template includes a file ```.env``` which is used to hold values that shouldn't be shared on github, for example an apikey to be used with an online api or other client credentials. The notebooks make these items accessible locally, but will not retain them in the online github repository. You must install ```python-dotenv``` to access this functionality. You can install it stand alone as follows:

```
  pip install -U python-dotenv
```
Or you can install all required packages with the instructions given in the next section.

#### Accessing Environment Variables in Jupyter Notebook
-------------
Notebook access to the constants and variables stored in the ```.env``` file is described here. In a code cell the line (e.g. assume you have a variable named ```APIKEY = 'Your_APIKEY'``` in the  ```.env``` file)
```
  mykey = %env APIKEY`  
```
will place the value ```'Your_APIKEY'``` into ```mykey```

### Installing development requirements
------------
If your current environment does not meet requirements for using this template execute the following:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
